Notes for the Website on Things to modify, or plans for certain aspects:

Create database, will be hosted on ElephantSQL. Will be a database for each puzzle individually. Will contain the image URL (which will be 
on a separate hosted thing online?), will also have the solution text, hint text, pdf link, and possibly later a date added. 

This way, however, can load the page dynamically. See if dynamic loading can occur with multiple pages. 

Better sized modals. Modals for both the hint and solution text, so it doesn't weirdly expand in on the page, and looks nicer.
